# Airbnb and the Barcelona Housing Crisis

**Project Overview**
This research examines how Airbnb expansion affects housing affordability across five major European cities (Barcelona, Venice, Berlin, Madrid, and Paris). We analyze the relationship between short-term rentals, housing prices, and tourism regulations from 2008 to 2025 using data from Inside Airbnb, Eurostat, and regional housing markets.
